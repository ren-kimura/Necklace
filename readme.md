# About
This project implements edge-centric and node-centric De Bruijn Graphs and generates a cycle/path cover from FASTA-format input.

# Building
Run the following command in the same directory as `rep.cpp` to compile the code:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the executable `rep`.

# Usage
To run the program, use the following command (if you add a PATH to the directory):

```bash
rep [flag] [path to <input.fa>] [k] [option]
```

- set `[flag]` with respect to the purpose of computation
    - 0 : Computes representations of node-centric path/cycle cover.
    - 1 : Computes Eulertigs in unidirected edge-centric de Bruijn graph.

- `[path to <input.fa>]` is a path to an input FASTA file. Extension can be omitted. In this case, ".fa" will be automatically added to open the file.

- `[k]` is the length of the k-mer $(2\leq k\leq 31)$.

- `[option]` is the output option (only needed when `[flag] = 0`):
    - 0 : Outputs plain text representation without pointers.
    - 1 : Outputs representation with unsorted pointers.
    - 2 : Outputs representation with sorted pointers.
    - 3 : Outputs tree representation with BP.

# Example
```bash
rep 0 input.fa 11 2
```
This command processes the input file `input.fa` with k-mer length 11 and generates a representation with sorted pointers.

```bash
rep 1 input.fa 11
```
This command processes the input file `input.fa` with k-mer length 11 and computes Eulertigs (not bidirected).

# Requirements
- C++17 or later
- Standard C++ libraries
- POSIX compliant system for memory management functions
